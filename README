Note to contributors:

By sending us patches, you automatically license the code under the same terms
as Munin.

We also might edit your commits metadata (the comment part) for clarifications,
but we'll leave the diff part intact (except for whitespace edits). So in case
there's a problem with the commit diff, we either commit another patch
thereafter or plainly ask you to rework it. We might eventually squash some of
your commits into one.

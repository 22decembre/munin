Getting Started
================

Installation
------------

Before you can use Munin you need to install it, of course. It is possible that
Munin is already installed at your site, either because it was included in your
operating system distribution or because the system administrator already
installed it. If that is the case, you should obtain information from the
operating system documentation or your system administrator about how to access
Munin.

If you are installing Munin yourself, then refer to Install Chapter for
instructions on installation, and return to this guide when the installation is
complete. Be sure to follow closely the section about setting up the
appropriate configuration files.

If your site administrator has not set things up in the default way, you might
have some more work to do, as the examples that follow will need to be adapted.

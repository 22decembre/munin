Further Information
====================

Besides the documentation, that is, this guide, there are other resources about Munin:

Web
===

The `Munin web site`__ carries the most details on the latest release and other
information to make your work or play with Munin more productive. It has a wiki
format, so you can easily add some content.

__ http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/WikiStart

One very important part is the `FAQ`__ (Frequently Asked Questions), which
contains most answers to a wide array of questions.

__ http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/faq

Mailing Lists
=============

The mailing lists are a very good place to have your questions answered, to
share experiences with other users, and to contact the developers.

Consult the Munin web site for details.

Yourself!
=========

Munin is an open-source project.

As such, it depends on the user community for ongoing support. As you begin to
use Munin, you will rely on others for help, either through the documentation
or through the mailing lists. Consider contributing your knowledge back. Read
the mailing lists and answer questions.

If you learn something which is not in the documentation, write it up and
contribute it. If you add features to the code, contribute them.

IRC
===

The most immediate way to get hold of us is to join our IRC channel:

        ``#munin on server irc.oftc.net``

The main timezone of the channel is Europe+America.

If you can explain your problem in a few clear sentences, without too
much copy&paste, IRC is a good way to try to get help. If you do need
to paste log files, configuration snippets, scripts and so on, please
use a pastebin_.

If the channel is all quiet, try again some time later, we do have
lives, families and jobs to deal with also.

You are more than welcome to just hang out, and while we don't mind
the occational intrusion of the real world into the flow, keep it
mostly on topic, and dont paste random links unless they are *really*
spectacular and intelligent.

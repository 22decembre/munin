.. _Munin-Exchange:

Munin Exchange
--------------

Was a web platform in the beginning setup and hosted by Linpro (Bjorn Ruberg?).
Later (when?) a Munin supporter re-invented the `Munin Exchange` website to improve its usablity.
When he left the project (when?) it was not possible to maintain the website any longer,
because it was coded in Python with Django and Steve Schnepp said "we clearly lack skills on that".
So it was decided to move all the plugins repository over to github branch "contrib".

Github is now the official way of contributing 3rd-party plugins to
get them included in the core collection by the Munin developer team.

They are tagged with **familiy contrib** (see: ``--family contrib``) in :ref:`munin-node-configure <munin-node-configure>`.

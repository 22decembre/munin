<h2>Welcome to the Munin Plugin Gallery</h2>

<p>This is the place where you can browse description and images for all plugins delivered with the munin distribution. 
It is not ready and complete yet. Example graph images are still missing and many plugins lack from perldoc sections. 
Help from contributors is welcome :-)</p>

<p>In a second step, we will build such an auto-generated HTML presentation on the web 
also for the 3rd party plugin collection in the contrib repository. You may start today
adding appropriate perldoc sections in the plugin script files and example graph images there.
The more content for this gallery is there already the more helpful the Plugin Gallery will be ~</p>

<p>Have a look at our instructions in the <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/PluginGallery">Munin Wiki</a></p>

<p>And now start browsing the plugin collection with a click on the category in the left side menu.</p>
